# How I Built This Project

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to build the Excel-based invoice management system, including setting up the sheets, implementing data validation, and automating processes using VBA macros.

---

## Step 1: Setting Up the Excel Sheets

### 1.1 Creating the Invoice Form
* Designed the main invoice form layout.
* Used data validation to create predefined terms such as **30, 60, 90 days** for payment terms.

### 1.2 Creating the Customer Detail Sheet
* Created a dedicated sheet to store customer details (**name, contact, address, etc.**).
* Implemented data validation to ensure consistency in entries.

### 1.3 Automating the Invoice Section
* Set up data validation to pull customer details into the invoice form when selecting a customer.
* Implemented formulas to autofill invoice details based on selections.

### 1.4 Logging Issued Invoices
* Created an **Invoice Record Sheet** to track:
  * Issued invoices
  * Amounts
  * Dates
  * Customer details
* This serves as a historical record for all transactions.

---

## Step 2: Implementing VBA Macros for Automation

### 2.1 Automated Invoice Creation
* Created a button to generate a new invoice with an automatically assigned invoice number.
* Integrated logic to pull customer details from the **Customer Detail Sheet** when selecting a customer.

**VBA Code:**
```vba
' Code will be added here
```

### 2.2 Recording and Saving Invoices
* Developed a macro to record invoices into the **Invoice Record Sheet**, keeping a log of all generated invoices.
* Enabled users to save invoices as Excel files for future reference.

**VBA Code:**
```vba
' Code will be added here
```

### 2.3 Exporting Invoice as PDF
* Implemented a VBA macro to export invoices as PDFs with a single click.
* Systematically named the PDF using the **invoice number** and **customer's name**.

**VBA Code:**
```vba
' Code will be added here
```

### 2.4 Email Invoice as PDF
* Used VBA macros to automatically attach the generated PDF to an email.
* Configured Outlook to open a new email draft with the invoice attached.
* Included a predefined subject and message for consistency.

**VBA Code:**
```vba
' Code will be added here
```

---

## Next Steps
* Add error handling to VBA macros for robustness.
* Improve user interface for better usability.
* Expand functionalities based on feedback.
