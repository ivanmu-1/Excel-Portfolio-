# Excel-Portfolio-

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase a variety of Excel projects and datasets that I have worked on. These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, automation, and advanced Excel techniques.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several folders, each dedicated to a different project or dataset. Below is an overview of some of the key projects:

### **Automated Customer Invoice System**
- A project that automates the generation and saving of customer invoices as Excel or PDF files.
- The system is designed to accept invoice data, format it according to the desired template, and save the invoice with a unique name and invoice number.
- The project includes instructions on how it was built and can be found in the documentation.
